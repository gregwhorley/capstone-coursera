        This method should return an ArrayList of type Rating, of movies and their weighted average ratings using
         only the top numSimilarRaters with positive ratings and including only those movies that have at least
         minimalRaters ratings from those top raters. These Rating objects should be returned in sorted order by
         weighted average rating from largest to smallest ratings. This method is very much like the getAverageRatings
         method you have written previously. In particular this method should:

        For every rater, get their similarity rating to the given parameter rater id. Include only those raters with
         positive similarity ratingsâ€”those that are more similar to rater id. Which method could you call?

        For each movie, calculate a weighted average movie rating based on: Use only the top (largest) numSimilarRaters
         raters. For each of these raters, multiply their similarity rating by the rating they gave that movie. This
         will emphasize those raters who are closer to the rater id, since they have greater weights. The weighted
         average movie rating for a particular movie is the sum of these weighted average ratings (for each rater
         multiply their similarity rating by their rating for the movie), divided by the total number of such ratings.

        This method returns an ArrayList of Ratings for movies and their calculated weighted ratings, in sorted order.
